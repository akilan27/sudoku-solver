# sudoku-solver
A simple solver for sudoku puzzle

This is ancient code from more than 10 years ago. I found this in deep interwebs of bygone era and putting it here for archival purposes. There are two files, one for windows/turbo-C compiler with conio.h (blame our college) and one that is portable but depends on ncurses. Technically the portable file is next version of the windows file but this is how we managed versions in our college in those days; may be even now they are doing the same; _awesome_ place, isn't it?
